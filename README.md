# Feature Discovery Widget

This package is based on the [feature_discovery package](https://pub.dev/packages/feature_discovery/),
 and removes all state management and provides just the widget. This forces a couple of breaking interface changes.

Further the following behaviours are being investigated:
- Have a way for the child to be the tap target
- Difference between barrier and background

## Status

This package is work in progress and not yet published.
